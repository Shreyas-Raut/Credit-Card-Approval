Responsible credit card use helps individuals establish and improve their credit history, enabling them to access favorable loan terms and financial products.\n",
        "- Credit cards also serve as a financial safety net during emergencies, providing quick access to funds. The rewards and perks associated with credit cards, such as cashback and travel benefits, enhance the overall customer experience. Moreover, credit cards offer security features and fraud protection, instilling confidence in users.\n",

Additionally, credit cards support risk management through sophisticated models, allowing banks to make informed lending decisions. Collaborations with businesses for co-branded cards further expand the customer base, making credit cards a strategic tool for both customers and banks."

Giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky. The credit card department has been using a data-driven system for credit assessment called Credit Scoring for many years, and the model is known as an application scorecard. A credit card application's cutoff value is determined using the application scorecard, which also aids in estimating the applicant's level of risk. This decision is made based on strategic priority at a given time.\n",
